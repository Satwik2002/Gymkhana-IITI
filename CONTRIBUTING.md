## Contributing to Gymkhana Central Website

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add. 
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. Fork the Gymkhana-IITI repo.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:
   - git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   
5. After making all the required changes, stage all the files for commit using add command
   - git add .

5. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions is 
necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
   - git commit -m "Your Message Here"

6. Push your branch to GitHub:
   - git push origin my-fix-branch

7. In GitHub, send a pull request to Gymkhana-IITI:master.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The central committee in charge of managing the repository reserves the right to accept or reject pull requests 
 
#### Addressing review feedback

	- git push origin --delete my-fix-branch

- Check out the master branch:
	- git checkout master -f

- Delete the local branch:
